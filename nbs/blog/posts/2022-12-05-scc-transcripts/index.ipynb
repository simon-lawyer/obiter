    "The Supreme Court of Canada is dedicated to promoting public access to its work, and one way it does this is by broadcasting webcasts of most of its hearings on its [website](https://scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/info/webcasts-webdiffusions-eng.aspx). These webcasts are an invaluable resource for anyone interested in the Court's proceedings, including lawyers, researchers, law students, and journalists. They allow these groups to see how the Court's judges engage with the issues before them, and to gain a better appreciation of the Court's work.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, video can be an imperfect medium for legal analysis. It is telling that most lawyers prefer to work with transcripts of proceedings because they are faster to review and easier to search. \n",
    "\n",
    "Video and audio are difficult to analyze quantitatively, making it challenging for researchers to explore patterns in argumentation and advocacy. In contrast, in the United States, [transcripts](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript/2022) of each Supreme Court case are published, providing researchers with a valuable tool for empirical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Video also poses accessibility problems. Without closed captions or transcripts, the information in video and audio files is inaccessible to people with some types of sensory disabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "To further support access to the Court's proceedings, and to provide resources to researchers, I have developed an AI transcriptionist that can automatically generate transcripts of the Court's proceedings from its webcasts. This technology can provide a new user-friendly and accessible way for individuals to access and analyze the Court's proceedings. It will also enable more comprehensive analyses of the Court's work, which could provide valuable insights and improve our understanding of Court's operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, I am [publishing 122 transcripts](https://obiter.ai/scc/), covering each webcast published between January 1, 2020 and November 3, 2022. Soon, I will open source all of my code. This transcriptionist can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- transcribe hours long hearings in seconds;\n",
    "- accurately transcribe French and English;\n",
    "- recognize different speakers;\n",
    "- note when people are speaking over each other; and,\n",
    "- correctly identify Supreme Court of Canada justices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an exciting technological moment. For cents on the dollar, an AI transcriptionist can produce a high fidelity, multi-lingual transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transcriptionist is based on the latest open-source technology. It uses the [whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/) and [pyannote](https://pyannote.github.io) libraries to accurately transcribe and diarize speech, and the [SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io) library for advanced speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the transcriptionist is far from perfect, and its outputs should be used cautiously. In some cases, the transcriber inappropriately guess at or hallucinates meaning that is not present in the text. In other cases, it inappropriately repeats itself, getting stuck in its own loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like human transcriptionists, the AI often gets names wrongs and struggles when people speak over each other. With further development and time, no doubt the technology will improve."
